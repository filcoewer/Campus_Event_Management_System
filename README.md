# Campus Event Management System

This is a simple application to manage campus events. A console version is provided as well as a basic Swing based GUI. Students can browse and register for events, while organizers can create events.

Compile and run with:

```
javac -encoding UTF-8 src/*.java
java -cp src CampusEventManagementSystem
```

To start the GUI instead run:

```
javac -encoding UTF-8 src/*.java
java -cp src CampusEventManagementGUI
```

Sample accounts:
```
Organizer: org1
Students: stu1, stu2
```
